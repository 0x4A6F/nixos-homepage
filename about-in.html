<h1>About Nix</h1>

<p>Nix is a <em>purely functional package manager</em>.  This means
that it treats packages like values in purely functional programming
languages such as Haskell — they are built by functions that don’t
have side-effects, and they never change after they have been built.
Nix stores packages in a <em>Nix store</em>, usually the directory
<tt>/nix/store</tt>, where each package has its own unique
subdirectory such as

</p>

<pre class="code">
/nix/store/r8vvq9kq18pz08v249h8my6r9vs7s0n3-firefox-2.0.0.1/
</pre>

<p>

where <tt>r8vvq9kq…</tt> is a unique identifier for the package that
captures all its dependencies (it’s a cryptographic hash of the
package’s build dependency graph).  This enables many powerful
features.</p>

<h3>Multiple versions</h3>

<h3>Complete dependencies</h3>

<h3>Multi-user support</h3>

<h3>Atomic upgrades and rollbacks</h3>

<pre class="code">
$ nix-env -u <em>some-packages</em>
$ nix-env --rollback
</pre>

<h3>Garbage collection</h3>

<pre class="code">
$ nix-collect-garbage -d
</pre>

<h3>Transparent source/binary deployment</h3>

<p>source deployment model (like <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>) and a binary model (like RPM)</p>

<h3>Reproducibility</h3>

<h3>Binary patching</h3>

<h3>Functional package language</h3>

self-contained etc.

variability through function arguments

<h3>Service deployment</h3>

<h3>Nix Packages collection</h3>

<h3>NixOS</h3>


<h3>About us</h3>

<p>Nix was developed at the <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/">Department
of Information and Computing Sciences</a>, Utrecht University by the
<a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/Trace/WebHome">TraCE project</a>.
The project is funded by the Software Engineering Research Program <a
href="http://www.jacquard.nl/">Jacquard</a> to improve the support for
variability in software systems.</p>

<!--

<ul>

  <li>Inherent support for simultaneous installation of multiple
  versions or variants of the same package.  No more DLL hell.</li>

  <li>Enforcement of package dependency specification: if a package
  builds, then its dependencies are complete.</li>

  <li>Automatic determination of runtime package dependencies.</li>

  <li>Multi-user support: users can install software without root
  privileges.  Users can have their own sets of installed software
  (<em>profiles</em>).</li>

  <li>Atomic upgrades — there is never a time window during a package
  upgrade in which the system is in an inconsistent state.</li>

  <li>Rollbacks.</li>

  <li>Garbage collection of unused packages.</li>

  <li>Source deployment model (a la Gentoo), but Nix will
  automatically use binary packages instead of building from source if
  pre-built binaries are available.</li>

  <li>Reproducibility: Nix expressions describe how to build a package
  plus all its dependencies, so they are self-contained.</li>

  <li>Efficient upgrading through binary patching.</li>

</ul>
