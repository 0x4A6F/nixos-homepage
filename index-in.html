<h1>Nix</h1>

<p>Nix is a package manager.  Traditional package managers (such as
RPM) have many limitations: it is hard to have multiple versions of a
package installed side-by-side, it is difficult to do a roll-back if
an upgrade turns out to be undesirable, they donâ€™t ensure complete
dependency information, and so on.  Nix fixes all that.  <a
