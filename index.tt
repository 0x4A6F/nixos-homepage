<h1>The Nix project</h1>

<p>Welcome to the homepage of the Nix project, which consists of a
number of related open source subprojects:</p>

<ul>
  
  <li><a href="nix/"><strong>Nix</strong></a> is a <em>purely
  functional</em> package manager.  This means that it can ensure that
  an upgrade to one package cannot break others, that you can always
  roll back to previous version, that multiple versions of a package
  can coexist on the same system, and much more.</li>

  <li><a href="nix/"><strong>Nixpkgs</strong></a> is a large
  collection of packages that can be installed with the Nix package
  manager.</li>
    
  <li><a href="nixos/"><strong>NixOS</strong></a> is a Nix-based Linux
  distribution.  Thanks to Nix, it supports atomic upgrades, rollbacks
  and multi-user package management, and it has a declarative approach
  to system configuration management that makes it easy to reproduce a
  configuration on another machine.</li>

  <li><a href="hydra/"><strong>Hydra</strong></a> is a Nix-based
  continuous build system.</li>

</ul>
