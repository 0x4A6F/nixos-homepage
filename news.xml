      NixOS progress report

      NixOS is now <h:em>almost</h:em> usable as a desktop OS ;-).  We
      have an X server, a bunch of Gnome packages, basic wireless
      support, and of course all the applications in Nixpkgs that we
      had all along running on other Linux distributions.  Here are a
      few screenshots:

        <li><a href="nixos/screenshots/nixos-terminals.png">Emacs and
        a few terminals</a> showing off the (near) absence of
        <tt>/lib</tt>, <tt>/bin</tt> etc.; everything is in the Nix
        store.</li>

      New build farm hardware at TUD
    </title>
    <description>

       class="inline"

       alt="New build farm" /></h:a>To quote Eelco Visser: new
       hardware for buildfarm at Delft University of Technology has
       arrived.</h:p>
       
       <h:p>Here’s what we have: 5 Intel Core 2 Duo DualCore machines
       with 1GB RAM, 2 Mac minis with 1,83-GHz Intel Core
       Duo-processor, another Core 2 Duo a UPS to deal with spikes in
       power supply, a console with integrated monitor and keyboard
       switches, a rack with room for a couple more machines.</h:p>

       <h:p>Here’s what we’re going to do with the goodies. The five
       Intel machines and the two MacMinis (also Intel) are going to
       be used to crank at building hundreds of software
       packages. Using virtualisation we should be able to run builds
       on multiple operating system distributions. <h:a

      Secure sharing paper accepted for ASE 2005
    </title>
    <description>
      The paper “Secure Sharing Between Untrusted Users in a
      Transparent Source/Binary Deployment Model” has been accepted at
      <h:a href="http://www.ase-conference.org/">ASE 2005</h:a>.  This
      paper describes how a Nix store can be securely shared by
      multiple users who may not trust each other; i.e., how do we
      prevent one user from installing a Trojan horse that is
      subsequently executed by some other user?

      Service deployment paper accepted for SCM-12
    </title>
    <description>
      The paper “Service Configuration Management” (accepted at the
      <h:a href="http://www.cs.ucsc.edu/~ejw/scm12/">12th
      International Workshop on Software Configuration
      Management</h:a>) describes how we can rather easily deploy
      “services” (e.g., complete webserver configurations such as our
      <h:a href="http://svn.cs.uu.nl">Subversion server</h:a>) through
      Nix by treating the non-component parts (such as configuration
      files, control scripts and static data) as components that are
      built by Nix expressions.  The result is that all advantages
      that Nix offers to software deployment also extend to service
      deployment, such as the ability to easily have multiple
      configuration side by side, to roll back configurations, and to
      identify the precise dependencies of a configuration.

      Patching paper accepted for CBSE 2005
    </title>
    <description>
      The paper “Efficient Upgrading in a Purely Functional Component
      Deployment Model” has been accepted at <h:a
      href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pacc/CBSE2005/">CBSE 2005</h:a>.
      It describes how we can deploy updates to Nix packages
      efficiently, even if “fundamental” packages like Glibc are
      updated (which cause a rebuild of all dependent packages), by
      deploying binary patches between components in the Nix store.
      Includes techniques such as patch chaining and computing deltas
      between archive files.
